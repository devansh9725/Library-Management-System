# Library Management System (DSA-based) Created by Devansh Wadhvana

## Overview
This is a Library Management System designed and implemented using **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, primarily in **C++**. It leverages advanced data structures such as **Trie**, **priority queues**, and **unordered maps** to efficiently manage books, users, and library operations. The system supports features like book search, user management, book issuance, and overdue tracking.

## Features
- **Efficient Book Search**: Implements a **Trie** data structure for case-insensitive book search and prefix matching.
- **Overdue Book Tracking**: Uses **priority queues** to keep track of overdue books and manage due dates efficiently.
- **Book Availability**: Utilizes **unordered maps** to track available books and total copies.
- **User Management**: Allows users to be added and manages the books they have issued.
- **Book Issuance and Return**: Supports issuing books to users, as well as handling returns, and updates the availability accordingly.
- **Overdue Notifications**: Displays overdue books and user details when books are past their due date.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: The programming language used to implement the system.
- **Data Structures**: 
  - **Trie** for efficient book search and prefix matching.
  - **Priority Queues** for managing overdue books.
  - **Unordered Maps** for fast lookups of books and user data.
- **C++ Standard Library**: Used for memory management and efficient data handling.
